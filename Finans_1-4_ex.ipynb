    "    a) To provide efficient access to risk premia across asset classes.\n",
    "    b) To generate long-term performance regardless of liabilities.\n",
    "    c) To replicate the present value of liabilities by matching risk factors like interest rates and inflation.\n",

Key factors that enable risk reduction without sacfriciing expected returns , is the correleation between assets , where you find that if you combine two assets that are correlated in some way there's a ratio where your returns go up and risk goes down.

The mangetidude of the value at risk is thrown away because that information is in the \"tail\" of the distrubution. CVAR is the correct answer here and it measures what happens if you cross the VAR threshold. \n",
