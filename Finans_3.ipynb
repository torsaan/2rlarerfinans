IE Nuclear energy goes down because of event, if not 100% in nuclear energy but some in solar, solar might go up. Now you could again say that you are at specific risk within the energy sector as your assests are still correleated within a certain sector. Next would be that you are in the energy/tech/industry sector and we could keep going...//\n",
