    "# Extensions of Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI)\n",

    "This lecture discusses two useful extensions to the basic CPPI strategy:\n",
    "1.  Protecting a **maximum drawdown floor**.\n",
    "2.  Protecting a portfolio with both a **floor and a cap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Protecting a Maximum Drawdown Floor\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this strategy is to ensure that the portfolio's value never falls more than a predefined percentage from its highest point ever reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Asset Value Process ($V_t$)**: The value of your portfolio at time $t$.\n",
    "* **Running Max Process ($M_t$)**: Keeps track of the maximum value the portfolio has reached from time 0 to time $t$.\n",
    "    * Mathematically: $M_t = \\max_{0 \\le s \\le t} V_s$\n",
    "* **Maximum Drawdown Constraint**: The strategy imposes a constraint that the current value $V_t$ must always be greater than a certain percentage ($\\alpha$) of the running maximum $M_t$.\n",
    "    * Constraint: $V_t > \\alpha \\cdot M_t$\n",
    "    * This ensures the maximum drawdown is limited to $(1 - \\alpha)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: 20% Maximum Drawdown\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to limit the maximum drawdown to **20%**, you set $(1 - \\alpha) = 0.20$, which means $\\alpha = 0.80$.\n",
    "* The constraint becomes: $V_t > 0.80 \\cdot M_t$.\n",
    "* The **floor** is now dynamic and is defined as $F_t = 0.80 \\cdot M_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics of the Maximum Drawdown Floor\n",
    "\n",
    "* The floor ($F_t = \\alpha \\cdot M_t$) is a **non-decreasing process**.\n",
    "* When the portfolio value $V_t$ increases and hits a new high, the running maximum $M_t$ increases, and therefore the floor $F_t$ also increases.\n",
    "* When the portfolio value $V_t$ decreases, the running maximum $M_t$ remains at its last peak, so the floor $F_t$ stays flat. It **never decreases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this strategy, you use the standard CPPI formula but with this dynamically defined floor:\n",
    "* **Exposure to Risky Asset** = $m \\cdot (\\text{Asset Value} - \\text{Floor})$\n",
    "* **Formula**: $E_t = m \\cdot (V_t - F_t) = m \\cdot (V_t - \\alpha \\cdot M_t)$\n",
    "    * Where $m$ is the multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. CPPI with a Floor and a Cap\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy is designed for investors who have a minimum amount of wealth they want to protect (a floor) but also a maximum target wealth (a cap) beyond which they have little desire to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "* Protecting downside (the floor) has an **opportunity cost** (giving up potential gains).\n",
    "* By also giving up on upside gains beyond a certain cap, the investor can generate an **opportunity gain**.\n",
    "* This opportunity gain can offset some or all of the opportunity cost of the downside protection.\n",
    "* This is useful for investors with a specific target or goal in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy uses a **threshold level ($T_t$)** that is set between the floor ($F_t$) and the cap ($C_t$). The allocation to risky assets changes depending on whether the portfolio value is above or below this threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Below the Threshold ($F_t \\le V_t < T_t$)**:\n",
    "    * The focus is on protecting the floor.\n",
    "    * The strategy behaves like standard CPPI.\n",
    "    * **Allocation**: $E_t = m \\cdot (V_t - F_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Above the Threshold ($T_t < V_t \\le C_t$)**:\n",
    "    * The focus shifts from protecting the floor to avoiding overshooting the cap.\n",
    "    * The strategy starts reducing risk as the portfolio value gets closer to the cap.\n",
    "    * **Allocation**: $E_t = m \\cdot (C_t - V_t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determining the Threshold ($T_t$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold is chosen to ensure a smooth transition in allocation. This is achieved through a **\"smooth-pasting condition\"**, which requires that the allocation formula is the same whether you approach the threshold from below or from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the exact moment $V_t = T_t$, the two allocation rules must be equal:\n",
    "    $$m \\cdot (T_t - F_t) = m \\cdot (C_t - T_t)$$\n",
    "* Solving for $T_t$:\n",
    "    $$T_t - F_t = C_t - T_t$$\n",
    "    $$2T_t = C_t + F_t$$\n",
    "    $$T_t = \\frac{F_t + C_t}{2}$$\n",
    "* The threshold is simply the **average (midpoint)** of the floor and the cap.\n",

    "Protecting downside while genereating upside performance potential \n",
